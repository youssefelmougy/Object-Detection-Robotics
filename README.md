# Object Detection - Robotics

This project implements a neural network to classify Japanese calligraphy characters, and use it alongside GTSAM to perform simultaneous localization & mapping (SLAM) with loop closures.

The object_detection.ipynb notebook should be used on a Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook to interactively see the calligraphy detection and robot movements.

The following shows the results of using object detection in localizing a robots movements:
